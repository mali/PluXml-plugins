Here are my plugins for PluXml[1] blog.

* clustrmap
  is a plugin for clustrmap[2], it loads the needed javascript on every page.
  just copy it in plugins/, it doesn't display the map, you need de do it yourself.

* slimbox2
  is a plugin for slimbox2[3]. Need the pluxml jquery plugin
  an example here: http://blog.naturalevent.fr/article17/plugin-slimbox2

* ganalytics
  is a simple google analytics plugin.
  edit ganalytics.php and replace XX-YYYYYYYY-Z with your site ID.
